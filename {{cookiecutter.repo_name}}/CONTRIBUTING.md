# Contributing

1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Make your changes on the `src` folder, never on the `dist` folder.
4. Commit your changes: `git commit -m 'Add some feature'`
5. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
6. Submit a pull request :D

Before sending a pull request, remember to:
* Follow [Felix's Node.js Style Guide](http://nodeguide.com/style.html)
* Run `grunt` to generate the latest files in `{{ cookiecutter.repo_name }}/dist/`
